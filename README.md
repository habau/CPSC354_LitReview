**Name:** Hannah Bauer

## Overview:
My literature review will focus on exploring the intersection of programming language, Human-Computer Interaction, and Accessible immersive technologies used for people with disabilities. My investigation uses a Large Language Model (LLM), ChatGPT 4o.

## Historical Developments in the intersection of Programming Languages, HCI, and the development of accessible technologies for people with disabilities
* Assistive technology for individuals with disabilities has roots dating back to the 1970s. Early attempts to create assistive technologies included screen readers and voice synthesizers for visually impaired users.
* The invention of JAWS (Job Access with Speech) in the 1980s was a significant milestone
* The concept of Universal Design emerged in the 1980s and 1990s, championed by architect Ronald Mace, advocating for designing products and environments usable by all people, regardless of age or ability. This movement influenced how digital interfaces were designed, particularly as computers became more integral to daily life.
* The World Wibe Web Consortium introduced the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines in 1999, setting the global standard for web accessibility.
* HTML, CSS, React, and JavaScript were updated to integrate accessibility features such as ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applicaitons), allowing developers to build websites and web apps that could be navigated using assistive technologies.
* Python has libraries such as OpenCV for computer vision and speech recognition libraries which enabled developers to create voice-controlled systems and visual tracking tools for users with motor impairments.
* C# became integral to Unity to create VR and AR applications where developers could use spatial audio and gesture recognition to create immersive environments accessible to users with disabilities.

# Subsfields of Programming Languages that contributed to accessibility challenges:
* Declarative programming using languages like HTML and CSS allow developers to describe the structure of content, which is essential for building accessible UI.
* ARIA attributes in HTML: help ensure that websites are readable.
* Domain-Specific Languages specialize tools for accessibility. Examples are Blockly and Scratch, which are block drag-and-drop based programming languages, allowing users with cognitive or motor disabilities to be able to learn programming languages.
* Object-Oriented Programming languages like Python and C#: fundamental languages for building VR/AR applications using voice controls or gesture recognition.

# How Subfields influence each other
* Declarative and functional programming: Makes websites more accessible.
* OOP and DSL's: Used for gesture control or voice recognition to work together.
* Declaractive programming and HCI: work closely with HCI principles to reduce cognitive load and improve usability.

## LLM Used for Investigation
For my literature review, I used ChatGPT-4o to explore my questions and expand my research. Here are some more questions that I asked the LLM and summaries of its responses:

## A conversation with ChatGPT-4o
* **Question:** How can programming language design and HCI principles be leveraged to create more accessible and immersive technologies for people with disabilities?

* **Relevant Concepts**
The following links provide information on programming languages that allow developers to build accessible and immersive experiences tailored to next-gen platforms which makes them integral in creating new technologies for audiences with alternative ways to learn and use technology.

* ([C# with AR/VR](https://clouddevs.com/c-sharp/augmented-reality/))
* ([Languages for VR developers](https://www.codemonkey.com/blog/5-must-know-languages-for-vr-developers/))

**Conversation with LLM, using ChatGPT 4o**
* **Question:** How can certain language features (ex. declarative or domain-specific languages) simplify the development of accessibility tools?
* Certain language features can simplify the development of accessibility tools by reducing complexity and enhancing focus on the desired functionality, enabling developers to build more intuitive, maintainable, and efficient systems.
* For example, developers building screen reader functionality or voice-based navigation can use declarative languages to specify which elements should be accessible to assistive technologies, rather than writing imperative code that manually handles accessibility logic.
* Declaration frameworks like React allow developers to easily build user interfaces that are accessible by default, using built-in components and attributes that simplify the process of creating accessible web applications.
* Another example is Blockly, a visual DSL used to create educational programming enviornments for children with cognitive or motor disabilities. The language abstracts away many complexities of coding, offering a drag-and-drop interface which enhances accessibility.

* **Question:** How do HCI principles such as universal design, cognitival load reduction, and usability contribute to creating more accessible interfaces for people with disabilities, and what are some examples of their application in real-world technologies?
* ChatGPT said, "universal design creates an interface that can be used by all people, without the need for adaptation or specialized design. This principal encourages inclusive development practices that avoid creating separate versions of a product for different groups of users. In the context of accessibility, universal design helps integrate features that serve users with disabilities from the start, rather than after. An application of this is voice assistants such as Siri and Alexa. Both use a natural language for users, including those with visual impairments, to interact with devices through speech rather than relying on screens. This universal design makes technology accessible without needing input through keyboards or touchscreens."
* Cognitive load reduction means simplifying interactions and removing unnecessary complexity. This makes it easier for users, especially those with disabilities, to process the information. This rule creates an intuitive intercace that does not overwhelm the user. An example of this is navigation menus in websites and consistent design icons and elements. Minimalist interfaces help with the idea of reducing cognitive load, which avoids clutter that may overwhelm users.

## Conclusion
In this literature review, I explored the intersection of programming languages with HCI, and the development of accessible technologies for people with disabilities. Historical developments in accessibility, from early assistive technologies like screen readers to modern immersive tools such as virtual reality (VR), show how these fields have evolved together. The implementation of universal design, cognitive load reduction, and usability principles through programming languages has been essential in ensuring that digital environments are inclusive and effective for users with diverse abilities.

Declarative languages like HTML and domain-specific languages (DSLs) have enabled developers to build accessibility features directly into the frameworks of web applications, while object-oriented and functional programming paradigms have allowed for modular and predictable software design. 

As we look ahead, the development of more powerful programming tools, integrated with HCI principles, will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of accessible technology. With further collaboration between subfields of programming languages and advances in assistive technologies, we can expect more immersive and universally accessible systems that enhance the digital experience for all users.

The coupling of programming languages and HCI creates opportunities to push the boundaries of what is possible in terms of accessibility, ultimately improving the quality of life for people with disabilities and fostering a more inclusive digital world.
